# How to SetUp MineCraft Server (Java Edtion)

## 1 Different versions of MincCraft servers

### 1.1 Vanilla

A “vanilla” Minecraft server is an unmodified server and is in the original format direct from the creator (Mojang).
Vanilla Minecraft has no support for plugins.
Yuu could download it from  <https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/>

### 1.2 CraftBukkit

CraftBukkit is a modified version of the Vanilla Minecraft server files.  The Bukkit team has modified in such a way that allows for plugins to be used with the game.

### 1.3 Spigot

Spigot was created from the CraftBukkit source code, but has been highly optimized for performance

## 2 Download MineCraft server

You could download Vanilla, CraftBukkit or Spigot from <https://getbukkit.org/download/>, but the build is not updated when I check it.

I went to <https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/> down the spigot buildTool, and build the latest version from source code myself.

You could download my build of spigot server from my page below:

- **[click to download minecraft_spigot-1.15.2.zip](./minecraft_spigot-1.15.2.zip)**

## 3 Download and install Java

if you didn't have java be installed in your computer, you need got to <https://java.com/en/download/>, click "java download" button.
But Note, when you install java, pleast check **"NO"** to any other App like Yahoo Search,  and select **Do NOT update browser setting** and click Next.

- **[link to download Java](https://java.com/en/download/)**

## 4 Run Spigot Minecraft Server

After installed the java, and download the spigot zip file. you could unzip the spigo-1.15.2.zip. The zip file has 3 files:
![spigot-1.15.2.zip](./spigot-1.15.2.zip.png)

create a folder and put 3 files there.
then you could click **"StartMineCraftServer.bat"**, the server will start like below:
![minecraftserver.png](./MinecraftServer.png)

the command in the batch file is like below
`java -Xms512M -Xmx1024M -jar spigot-1.15.2.jar`

if you don't want see the gui and want to incease min memory use, you could change the start script to:
`java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar spigot-1.15.2.jar nogui`

## 5 Configure the Minecraft Server

After you first time run the minecraft server, you will find the folder will has couple files and folder be created:
![spigotfolder.png](./spigotFolder.png)

You could update the server.properties to change the server settings.
