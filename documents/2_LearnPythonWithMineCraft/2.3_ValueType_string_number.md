# 2.3 Data Types String and Number

## 1 Use PostToChat to print a "String" to Minecraft

In Python any amount of text call a `string`, you could use string like this

```python
print("Hello Minecraft")

name ="Steve the Miner"

print(name)
```

### - [Mission-3.1] Say Hello to other in the Minecraft

To say "Hello" to everybody in the Minecraft server, you could do below

```python
from mcpi_e.minecraft import Minecraft
serverAddress="server-address" # change to your minecraft server
playerName ="yourname"
pythonApiPort=4711

mc=Minecraft.create(serverAddress,pythonApiPort,playerName)
mc.postToChat("Hello!")

```

### [Mission-3.2] Use Python Input Function input other's nae

You could take the data from input, try blow

```python
name=input("What's your name?")
mc.postToChat(playerName+" say: Hello, "+name+"!")
```

### [Mission-3.3] Try the format function to build a string

Other than user "+" to connect string into a sentense, you could use format function:

```python
yourName ="stoneskin2020"
aname=input("Who you want say hello to?")
print("{} say: Hello {}!".format(yourName,aname))
```

## 2 Convert a String to Number with `int()`

String and Intiger is different DataType, for detail please read [Python Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp).
Below is the Data Types we possible will used in our class

![datatypes](https://stoneskin.github.io/SummerCamp_Python_Minecraft/datatypes.jpg)

example of get type of a variable:

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))
```

The data you got form input is a string, we need convert to number before using as number. `int(str)` could do this job.

```python
blockType=input("Enter a block type:")
blockTypeId=int(blockType)

```

other way if you want change a int to string, you could use `str(number)`

```python
value=103
print("Watermelon block id is "+str(value))
```

### [Mission-3.4] Create a block with input

```python
...
blockType= #add input() function here
blockTypeId= # add conver code here

x,y,z=pos=mc.player.getTilePos()

mc.setBlock(x,y,z,blokTypeId)

```

### [Mission-3.5] Use `try: except:` to get the error

Python will throw the error to the terminal, you can get that error message and handle it.

```python
try:
    number=int(input("what's the block type you want get?"))
except:
    print("Invalid input: please enter a number!")
```

add upper code to your previous code, and try it.

### [Mission-3.6] Use `Sleep` to wait some time

Some time you want wait some time and continue run your code, you could use `sleep`

```python
import time # this need use time module
time.sleep(30) #Make the program wait 30 seconds
```

Please finish below code to check how long you move

```python
import time
from mcpi_e.minecraft import Minecraft
serverAddress = "the server" # change to your minecraft server
playerName = "your user name" # change to your username
pythonApiPort = 4711
mc = Minecraft.create(serverAddress,pythonApiPort,playerName)

pos1 = mc.player.getTilePos()

time.sleep(15) # change to the second you like to wait

pos2=mc.player.getTilePos()

#compaire the distance
xDistance = pos1.x - pos2.x
yDistance = pos1.y - pos2.y
zDistance = pos1.z - pos2.z

print("x-distance="+xDistance+"  y-distance="+yDistance+" z-distance="+zDistance)
# Post the results to the chat
mc.postToChat("x-distance={}  y-distance={} z-distance={}".format(xDistance,yDistance,zDistance))
```

### [Mission-3.7][Charlenage] Put them together

Write a python script do below:

1. use `for` loop to run this 5 times
2. In each loop, ask user input a block type between 0 to 250. ([blocktype id list](https://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/), some id is not works)
3. if user give is not a valid number print "please give a valid blocktype" (use `try..except`)
4. get the user's current tile position, and place block
5. [charllenge] ask the user input howmany blocks you want to stack, modify the code to build a stacks of block
