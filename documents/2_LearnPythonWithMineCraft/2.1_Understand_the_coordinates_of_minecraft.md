# Learn Python With MineCraft

  *- have fun with programming and game*

## 2.1 Understand the coordinates of minecraft

Minecraft coordinates is different than what we learn from geometry. you need keep below picture in mind when you do the minecraft coding.
![coordinates of minecraft](../minecraft_Coordinates.png)

For basic python syntax, pleas check [Python syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp) for details.
Below mission will use `print` and command from minecraft api `mcpi`

### To use below code example, please make sure use below code before the sample code.

```python
import mcpi_e.minecraft as minecraft
import mcpi_e.block as block
from math import *

address="127.0.0.1" # change to address of your minecraft server
name ="change to your user name"
mc = minecraft.Minecraft.create(address,4711,name)
pos=mc.player.getTilePos()
```

### - [Mission-1.1] Find your location

Use mcpi module to find the position (x,y,z) of the block your player stand on.
Use Python `print` command to display your location:

```python
pos= #get your position
print("pos: x:{},y:{},z:{}".format(pos.x,pos.y,pos.z))
```

hint:

```python
#return position with intiger number like (0,1,-10)
pos=mc.player.getTilePos()

# return posoition with float number like (1.02,1.23,-10.1)
pos=mc.player.getPos()
```

### - [Mission-1.2] Find the block type id of the block you are standing

Use this link to check the name of the block type id:

[![heart](./../heart.png) Minecraft ID list](https://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/)

Use `getBlock` command to find the block type:

```python
x=100
y=10
z=-10
id=mc.getBlock(x,y,z)
print("blockId:",id)
```

### - [Mission-1.3] Teleport to an exact position

Let me know how you die after teleport to a position :)

Code example:

```python
#move you to a given location
x=100
y=100
z=-10
print("teleport me to: x:{},y:{},z:{}".format(x,y,z))
mc.player.setTilePos(x,y,z)
```

### - [Mission-1.4] Teleport you to one direction with 100 blocks

Find out how to move yourselfe to east 100, then north, then west, then top etc.
use key `F3` to check your location after transport.

### - [Mission-1.5] Place a block on your location

Try place a watermelon beside you.

```python
# place a block

(x,y,z)=pos=mc.player.getTilePos()

mc.setBlock(x,y,z,103)

```
#### - [Mission-1.6] Use Python place multiple blocks point direction of x,y,z

Use python code to place color block like below

```python
mc=Minecraft.create(serverAddress,pythonApiPort,playerName)
pos=mc.player.getTilePos()
(x,y,z)=pos=mc.player.getPos()

mc.setBlock(x+1,y,z,block.WOOL_GREEN)
mc.setBlock(x+2,y,z,block.WOOL_RED)
mc.setBlock(x+3,y,z,block.WOOL_BLUE)
```
