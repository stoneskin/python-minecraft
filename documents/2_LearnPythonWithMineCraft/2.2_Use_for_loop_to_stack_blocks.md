# Learn Python With MineCraft

  *- have fun with programming and game*

## 2.2 Use `for` Loop to stack blocks

for learnning how to use `for` loop, please visit [Python For Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)

Below mission only need using `for ... range` loop.
![forloop](https://stoneskin.github.io/SummerCamp_Python_Minecraft/forloop.jpg)

### - [Mission-2.1]Stack 5 blocks without loop

You could repeat your code 5 times

```python
x,y,z = pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
# place 5 block
id=103
mc.setBlock(x,y,z,id)
mc.setBlock(x,y,z,id)
mc.setBlock(x,y,z,id)
mc.setBlock(x,y,z,id)
mc.setBlock(x,y,z,id)
```

### - [Mission-2.2] Stack 5 blocks by using `for` loop

Check below `for range` syntax,  please build 5 pillars around you.

```python
# for loop examplei
x,y,z = pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
id=103
for i in range(0,5):
   print("i=",i)
   mc.setBlock(x,y+i,z,id)

```

### -[Mission 2.3] Try set blocks

to use the setBlocks, you need pass two set of blocks

```python
mc.setBlocks(x,y,z,x1,y1,z1,blockId)
```

## Double loop

You could put one loop in another loop, it call double loop.

### - [Mission 2.4] use loop build a wall

let's start build a tower with single loop

```python
from mcpi_e.minecraft import Minecraft
from mcpi_e import block

serverAddress = "localhost" # change to your minecraft server
playerName = "stoneskin2020"
pythonApiPort = 4711

mc = Minecraft.create(serverAddress,pythonApiPort,playerName)

pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
x = pos.x
y = pos.y
z = pos.z

#build a tower use loop
for h in range(5):
    print("h=",h)
    mc.setBlock(x,y+h,z,block.STONE.id)
```

you could build couple of tower to make it wall

```python
for h in range(5):
    print("h=",h)
    mc.setBlock(x,y+h,z,block.STONE.id)
    mc.setBlock(x+1,y+h,z,block.STONE.id)
    mc.setBlock(x+2,y+h,z,block.STONE.id)
    mc.setBlock(x+3,y+h,z,block.STONE.id)
    mc.setBlock(x+4,y+h,z,block.STONE.id)
```

#### - [Mission 2.5] Use double loop build a wall

Try To use double loop:

```python
for h in range(5):
    for w in range(5):
        print("h={} w={}".format(h,w))
        mc.setBlock(x+w,y+h,z,block.STONE.id)
```

#### - [Mission 2.6] Add condition to your code of build wall

you could put some pattern on your wall, add below code to your missiion 2.13 code

```python
... loop
    ...
       if(w==y):
            mc.setBlock(x+w,y+h,z,block.BEDROCK.id)

```

#### - [Mission-2.7] Build a 5x5x5 Cube

you need 3 layers of loop,  see below example of add 3 layer of loop on mission 2.3.

```python

id=103
for k in range(0,5):
   for j in range(0,5):
      for i in range(0,5):
         mc.setBlock(x+j,y+i,z+k,id)

```

#### - [Mission-2.8] use double loop to explor the map

create a map, or use a map mods,
then try to use python code move your player to exploer the map
x from -1000 to 1000 step 75
z from -1000 to 1000 step 75
you need stay each place for 5 sec waiting for the view be loaded

```python
import time
for x in range(-1000,1000,75):
    time.sleep(5)
```

#### - [Challenge] [Mission-2.9] Build a pyramid in Minecraft

Modified your code in mission-2.15, build a pyramid.
please show you work by send your pyramid's location and your script to the teacher.
